## The Problem

AI Agents are being deployed without a reliable "brake pedal". When they hallucinate, jailbreak, or execute unsafe code — there's no hardware-level kill switch.

## Our Solution

SENTINEL is a **governance layer** between your AI and the operating system. We don't rely on prompts. We monitor at the **kernel level** and enforce containment physically.

> *"The first and last line of defense for enterprise AI."*
