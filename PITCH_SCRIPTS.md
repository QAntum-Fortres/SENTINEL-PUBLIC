## 📨 VARIANT 1: For VC Investors (Y Combinator, a16z, Sequoia)

**Subject:** A Deterministic Kill-Switch for LLM Agents (MVP Live)

Hi [Name],

We are rushing to deploy Autonomous AI Agents, but we lack a reliable "brake pedal" when they hallucinate or execute unsafe code.

I have built **SENTINEL** – a governance layer that sits between the LLM and the OS kernel.

**The Solution:** Unlike prompt-based guardrails (which can be jailbroken), SENTINEL uses eBPF monitoring to track the agent's resource consumption and API calls. If an agent exhibits "rogue" behavior (e.g., unauthorized SQL access or toxicity spikes), SENTINEL triggers an **Apoptosis Protocol**, killing the process in <1ms.

**Traction:** I have a working prototype demonstrating a live "Prompt Injection" attack and autonomous containment.

I am looking for a partner to bring this safety layer to the Enterprise market.

Best,

## 📨 VARIANT 2: For Corporate Clients (CTO at Banks/Fintech)

**Subject:** Ensuring AI Compliance: Automated Agent Containment System

Dear [Name],

Deploying GenAI in a regulated environment (Fintech/Banking) carries a massive risk: **Unpredictable Agent Behavior**.

I am reaching out to demonstrate **SENTINEL**, a proprietary safety architecture designed to wrap around your existing AI models.

**How it protects your infrastructure:**

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks token usage and sentiment drift.
- **Hardware-Level Control:** Physically isolates any AI instance that violates compliance rules (Zero-Trust).
- **Audit Trail:** Cryptographically signs every agent action.

**See the "Kill-Switch" in action here:**

This system allows you to deploy AI agents with a **mathematical guarantee of containment**. Are you open to a 10-minute technical demo?

Regards,

**Dimitar Prodromov**

## 🐉 ДВУГЛАВИЯТ ЗМЕЙ STRATEGY

You now have **TWO products**:

| Product | Target | Pitch |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **AIGIS** | Smart Cities / Government | "We protect power grids" |
| **SENTINEL** | Enterprise / Banks | "We stop rogue AI agents" |

**How to pivot mid-conversation:**

If investor says: *"Smart City is too slow/government-heavy"*

You respond:
> "I understand. The interesting thing is that the same architecture (Kernel-Level Isolation) is perfect for stopping hallucinating AI models. We have a version called SENTINEL, specifically for banks."

**Same core tech. Two markets. Double the opportunity.**
