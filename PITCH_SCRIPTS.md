## 🐉 ДВУГЛАВИЯТ ЗМЕЙ STRATEGY

You now have **TWO products**:

| Product | Target | Pitch |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **AIGIS** | Smart Cities / Government | "We protect power grids" |
| **SENTINEL** | Enterprise / Banks | "We stop rogue AI agents" |

**How to pivot mid-conversation:**

If investor says: *"Smart City is too slow/government-heavy"*

You respond:
> "I understand. The interesting thing is that the same architecture (Kernel-Level Isolation) is perfect for stopping hallucinating AI models. We have a version called SENTINEL, specifically for banks."

**Same core tech. Two markets. Double the opportunity.**
